HOW TO USE THIS FOLDER WITH GITHUB PAGES
----------------------------------------

1. Unzip this file on your computer.
2. You will see exactly these three items INSIDE the unzipped folder:
   - index.html
   - README_GITHUB.txt
   - fichas/   (folder with vocab.html inside)

3. Go to your GitHub repository (for example: English-Jorge-Unit-02-Vocab).
4. Click on "Add file" → "Upload files".
5. VERY IMPORTANT:
   - Upload ONLY these three items TO THE ROOT of the repository:
       index.html
       README_GITHUB.txt
       fichas (complete folder)
   - Do NOT create any extra folder on GitHub.

6. Commit the changes.

7. Go to Settings → Pages.
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main
   - Folder: / (root)
   - Save.

8. After a few seconds GitHub will show a public link.
   Something like:
   https://tuusuario.github.io/English-Jorge-Unit-02-Vocab/

9. Open that link. You should see the title and a button
   that opens the interactive vocabulary activity.

That's all. No extra folders, no moving files.
